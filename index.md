Welcome to my Baseball Analytics Repository! I am a senior at Yale majoring in Statistics & Data Science with a passion for baseball. This repository is a collection of various projects and analyses focused on different aspects of baseball, combining research, statistical techniques, and scouting insights.

Here are some different projects I've been working on:

- [Baseball Research](./baseball-research/)
- [Statcast 2023 Multivariate Analysis](./statcast2023-multivariate-analysis/)
- [Frontier League Scouting Samples](./frontier-league-pitcher-scouting-samples/)

**baseball-research:** This folder contains research projects exploring various topics in baseball analytics.

**statcast2023-multivariate-analysis:** This folder features a detailed multivariate analysis of Statcast data from the 2023 MLB season, focusing on hitters. In one project, I used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify key components driving hitting performance. In another I used Cluster Analysis to group hitters based on similar performance profiles.  

**frontier-league-pitcher-scouting-samples:** A collection of sample scouting reports for pitchers in the Frontier League, created using Yakkertech data. These reports provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of pitchers, leveraging advanced tracking technology.
